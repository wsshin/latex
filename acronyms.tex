\usepackage[single,mark-as-used=first,cite=first]{acro}  % mark-as-used only when the "first form" is used

% Some acronyms are used without definite and indefinite articles, whereas the articles are used in their long forms.  When some adjectives qualifies these terms, it becomes a problem.  For example, "the more commonly used uniaxial PML (UPML)" cannot be written as "the more commonly used \ac{upml}".
% Also, there are acronyms that include trailing words whose first characters do not appear in the acronyms.  (e.g., QMR for the quasi-minimal residual "method".)  When a family of these terms are used, it also becomes a problem.  For example, "the conjugate gradient (CG), biconjugate gradient (BiCG), and quasi-minimal residual (QMR) methods" cannot be written as "\ac{cg}, \ac{bicg}, and \ac{qmr}".
% Because there are too many problems in using \ac{...} only, use it sparingly, especially those with the above problems.  Use \acf{} when the term is used for the first time, and use \acs{} when it should be an acronym.
% Or, if I really want to use \ac{...}, then I should think about whether it will look good in all of the \acf{}, \acl{}, \acs{} forms.
